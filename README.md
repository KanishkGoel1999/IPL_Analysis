# SQL Data Exploration with IPL Dataset
Hello everyone, this is my first project using SQL and Tableau. This domain is close to my heart. I guess every Indian is a born cricketer/fan. Even Sundar Pichai is a cricket fan. Now please endure some exciting statistics for IPL 2008-2022. This project explores the data in the IPL dataset by using a variety of queries in SQL.

I have provided the raw data taken from Kaggle and the data I processed using SQL.
